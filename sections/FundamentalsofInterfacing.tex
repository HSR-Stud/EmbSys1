\begin{minipage}{9cm}
	\begin{itemize}

		\item Clock Oscillators
		\item Power on Reset
		\item Booting Function

\subsection{Power Sources 6.2 \embsys{250}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide Power to CPU and its peripherals
	\item Require Steady Voltage
	\item Establish reference Levels for internal Operations
	\item Absolute Maximum Ratings
	\subitem Maximum and Minimum supply values
	\subitem Level of Stress
	\subitem Do Not design operating device at these levels
	\item Recommended Operating Conditions
	\subitem Conditions where the device operating normal
	\item a typical MCU Power Supply consist of a Unregulated Power Source and then for each peripheral interface is a Voltage Regulator
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Terms of Power Sources \embsys{252}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Power-Speed Tradeoff, link between frequency and power transfer
		\item Choose IC's with same Voltage as MCU
		\item For different IC Voltage Level, fix with Pull Up/Down Resistor
		\item For Noise Control use Capacitor between V and GND, act as a low-pass filter
		\item Isolate Power Sourcees from the Rest of the Circuit
		\item Route separately analog and digital lines 
		\item Do not mix analog and digital parts
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Clock Sources 6.3 \embsys{260}}
Clocks are usually based on quartz cristal oscillator. This oscillator is based on mechanical vibration using the piezoelectric effect. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Embedded Systems need a steady clock
	\item Synchronous nature of CPU and peripherals
	\item Time Base for bus activity, timers, baud rates etc
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Parameters for Clock Signal}
\begin{minipage}{9cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Voltage Swing} (Amplitude between low-high) $V_{SW}=V_{OH}-V_{OL}$
		\item \textbf{Frequnecy} (Number of Cycles per second) \\$f_{clk}=1/T_{clk}$
		\item \textbf{Duty Cycle} (Ratio of high time to period)\\ $DC=t_{high}/T_{clk} \cdot 100 \%$
		\item \textbf{Edge Speed} (Rising and falling times)\\$t_r, t_f$
	\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{8cm}

\subsubsection{Clock Stability}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Clock Stability, Fluctuations of a clock signal over time intervall
	\item Clock Jitter, randomness of signal passing voltage threshold
	\item Clock Drift, change of frequency of an oscillator over time
\end{itemize}
